Master Thesis - PyAEDT Example\
February 2024

Description:\
This program is intended to give an example of the process used to generate 3-dimensional models of electrical machines in Ansys Maxwell using the PyAEDT library.\
The example shows a very simplified model used for demonstration purposes only.\
Geometry generation is based on previously defined coordinate points, which have been grouped together in the 'Class.py' file.\
The main interest lies in the 'main.py' file, where one can find the usefull PyAEDT functions used to generate the simulation model.\
This example presents only the basics of what has been used for the more complex models studied in the Thesis.

Installation\
Ansys Electronics Desktop has to be previously installed.\
The PyAEDT package has to be installed with 'pip install pyaedt'.\
The program has been successfully tested with Ansys Electronics Desktop 2023R2 and PyAEDT 0.7.12

Usage:\
Simply run the 'main.py' script and make sure than 'Class.py' is available to be imported.
